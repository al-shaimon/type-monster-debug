              <strong>Local Storage: </strong>The localStorage object allows you to save key/value pairs in the browser. The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data is not deleted when the browser is closed, and are available for future sessions.<br /><br>
              <strong>1: </strong>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. <br />
              <strong>2: </strong>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
              manually. <br />
              <strong>3: </strong>The client can only read local storage. <br />
              <strong>4: </strong>There is no transfer of data to the server. <br>
              <strong>5: </strong>There are fewer old browsers that support it. <br> <br>

              <strong>Session Storage: </strong>The sessionStorage object let you store key/value pairs in the browser. The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session. The data is deleted when the browser is closed<br><br>
              <strong>1: </strong>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB <br />
              <strong>2: </strong>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed <br />
              <strong>3: </strong>The client can only read local storage. They cann't read session storage. <br />
              <strong>4: </strong>There is no transfer of data to the server <br>
              <strong>5: </strong>There are fewer old browsers that support session storage.

              <strong>Global Scope: </strong>A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope. All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. <br><br>
              <strong>Block Scope: </strong>A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function. This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.

              <strong>The event loop: </strong>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br><br>
              <strong>Runtime concepts: </strong>The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily optimize the described semantics. <br>

              There are 8 ways to get <strong>Undefined</strong><br>
              <strong>1: </strong>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.<br>
              <strong>2: </strong>Function with no return.<br>
              <strong>3: </strong>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined.<br>
              <strong>4: </strong>If the return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.<br>
              <strong>5: </strong>Property that doesn't exist on an object will give you undefined.<br>
              <strong>6: </strong>Accessing array elements outside of the index range will give you undefined<br>
              <strong>7: </strong>Deleting an element inside an array<br>
