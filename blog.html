              <strong>Local Storage:</strong><br />
              <strong>1: </strong>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. <br />
              <strong>2: </strong>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
              manually. <br />
              <strong>3: </strong>The client can only read local storage. <br />
              <strong>4: </strong>There is no transfer of data to the server. <br>
              <strong>5: </strong>There are fewer old browsers that support it. <br> <br>

              <strong>Session Storage:</strong><br>
              <strong>1: </strong>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB <br />
              <strong>2: </strong>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed <br />
              <strong>3: </strong>The client can only read local storage. They cann't read session storage. <br />
              <strong>4: </strong>There is no transfer of data to the server <br>
              <strong>5: </strong>There are fewer old browsers that support session storage.

              <strong>Global Scope: </strong>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope. <br><br>
              <strong>Block Scope: </strong>This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped

              element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
              hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
              our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
              the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
